Project Description:

Water is considered as a vital resource that affects various aspects of human health and lives. The quality of water is a major concern for 
people living in urban areas. Quality of water serves as a powerful environmental determinant and a foundation for the prevention and control
of waterborne diseases. However predicting the urban water quality is a challenging task since thewater quality varies in urban spaces non-linearly
and depends on multiple factors, such as meteorology, water usage patterns, and land uses, so this project aims at building a Machine Learning (ML) 
model by considering all water quality standard indicators.
